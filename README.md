# Newtons Law of Gravitation
## Science part
According to Newtons law of Gravitaion:\
"Every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with the force directly propotional to the product of their masses and inversly propotional to the square of distance between them."  
Therefore  
F = G * M1 * M2 / r^2  

## Program part
1. Every particle in the Universe has a mass, occupies space and has a shape.
2. The best way to represent this in any program is the concept of Object oriented programming.
3. Thus we need to have a class of particle but also we will fix the shape of the particle as circle and thus we will create a class with the name of "ball".
